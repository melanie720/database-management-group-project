# database-management-group-project

Hello,

This repository contains the supporting files of my database management course group project.
We built a database environment for a business travel management firm that supports the creation of various performance reports involving the firm's travel agents and clients.

The full up-down script creates our tables, inserts the initial data, and creates the data logic using functions, triggers, and procedures.

Also included is a demo file where you can test out the database's functionality and see a few user stories in action.

Enjoy!
