# database-management-group-project

Hello,

This repository contains the supporting files of my database management course group project.

We designed and implemented a relational database environment for a business travel management firm that supports the creation of various performance reports involving the firm's travel agents and clients.

We begin with the [**Conceptual ERD**](1_Conceptual_Model_ERD.pdf) and [**Logical**](2_Logical_Model.pdf) models to structure our entities and attributes and to ensure data, entity, and referential integrity with proper constraints and keys.

The [**full up-down script**](3_Full_UpDown_Script_GitHub.sql) creates our tables, inserts the initial data, and creates the data logic using functions, triggers, and procedures.

Also included is a [**demo file**](4_Demos_GitHub.sql) where you can test out the database's functionality and see a few user stories in action.

Enjoy!
