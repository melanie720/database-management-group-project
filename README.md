# database-management-group-project

Hello,

This repository contains the supporting files of my database management course group project.
We built a database environment for a business travel management firm that supports the creation of various performance reports involving the firm's travel agents and clients.

The [full up-down script](1_Full_UpDown_Script_GitHub.sql) creates our tables, inserts the initial data, and creates the data logic using functions, triggers, and procedures.

Also included is a [demo file](2_Demos_GitHub.sql) where you can test out the database's functionality and see a few user stories in action.

Enjoy!
